		<!-- displays information -->
		<p> It all starts with the milk. When the milk arrives at the factory, it is poured into large vats. </p>

		<!-- displays information and images -->
		<p> Some starter bacteria is added to the milk. This starts the cheesemaking process and also adds flavour and texture. An enzyme called 'rennet' is also added to curdle the milk. </p>
		<p> When it is curdled, there is a thin, watery layer or liquid left on top called whey protein. Cheesemakers remove the whey, then add salt.</p>
		<p> The curds are then cut into smaller pieces and heated to remove the remaining whey.</p>
		<img src = "curdcutting.jpg" width = "500" height = "334" alt = "Curds being cut into smaller pieces.">
			
		<p> The whey drains off, leaving the curd tightly-packed. The curd is then pressed into a mold.</p>
		<img src = "cheesecubes.png" width = "500" height = "334" alt = "Cubes of cheese curd.">
			
		<p> Depending on the type of cheese being made, this is the aging stage, where the cheese is left for months or years to sharpen its flavour. </p>
		<p> The cheese is packaged, and delivered to be enjoyed by consumers.</p>
		<img src = "cheesepackaging.jpg" width = "500" height = "334" alt = "Cheese being packaged.">
		<p> Not every cheese is made the same way. Mozzarella is kneaded before being completely formed, giving it its signature stringy quality, and
			swiss cheese uses a bacteria that gives off carbon dioxide, which makes the bubbles in the cheese.
