			<h2 id = "cheddar" > Cheddar </h2>
		</div>
		<p> Originating from England, this cheese is used in plenty of dishes, including mac and cheese, grilled cheese, and burgers.
			Cheddar cheese is made from pasteurized cow's milk. It can have a white to pale yellow colour, but can
			also be orange, due to manually added colouring. Cheddar cheese has a 9 to 24 month aging process, and the texture changes depending 
			on the maturity of the cheese; fully mature cheese is crumbly, but young cheese is smooth. It has a tangy and sharp flavour,
			and is oh-so exquisite. </p>
		
		
		
		<div class = "container">
			<img src = "mozzarella.jpg" width = "90%" alt = "Mozzarella cheese">
			<h2 id = "mozz" > Mozzarella </h2>
		</div>
		<p>  Mozzarella cheese originated from Southern Italy, and was traditionally made from buffalo milk,
		but because the water buffaloes were only herded in specific countries, it is now mostly made with cow milk.
		Unlike cheddar cheese, mozzarella is not aged, and eaten fresh. It's stringy, semi-soft, and normally rolled into white balls.
		Mozzarella has a milky flavour, and is oh-so exquisite.</p>
		
		<div class = "container">
			<img src = "parmesan.jpg" width = "90%" alt = "Parmesan cheese">
			<h2 id = "parm" > Parmesan </h2>
		</div>
		<p> Parmesan, also called Parmigiano-Reggiano, is a hard, granular cheese originating from Italy.
			It is made from unpasteurized cow milk. Parmesan has a strong, sharp flavour, and is therefore used in small amounts.
			It also has a very strong aroma, and is oh-so exquisite. </p>
		
		<div class = "container">
			<img src = "gouda.jpg" width = "90%" alt = "Gouda cheese">
			<h2 id = "gouda"> Gouda </h2>
		</div>
		<p> Gouda, pronounced "how-da" by the locals, is a semi-hard to hard cow's milk cheese from the Netherlands.It is made from pasteurized or
		unpasteurized cow, sheep, or goat milk. When aged, it changes in flavour and in texture. Mature gouda is strong and sweet, but young gouda is softer and can be melted.
		Gouda has a waxed rind that is red, orange, or yellow when young, and black when old. It is dense, and can be springy or crumbly. Gouda has a pungent smell, but has a nutty, creamy, and rich flavour, and is oh-so exquisite. </p>
		
		<div class = "container">
			<img src = "brie.jpg" width = "90%" alt = "Brie cheese">
			<h2 id = "brie"> Brie </h2> 
		</div>
		<p> Brie cheese is a soft cheese made from cow milk, originating in Northeastern France. Under a rind of white mold, 
			it is described as having an earthy or mushroom-like flavour, and has a buttery, soft texture. When inproduction, the cheese 
			is cast into molds and left for 18 hours, then salted and aged forat least four weeks. Brie is nicknamed the "Queen of Cheeses", and is oh-so exquisite. </p>
		
		<div class = "container">
			<img src = "feta.jpg" width = "90%" alt = "Feta cheese">
			<h2 id = "feta"> Feta </h2>
		</div>
		<p> Feta cheese is a Greek cheese made from sheep and goat milk. Traditionally, feta is made with 30% goat milk. It is a white brined cheese that can be crumbly or creamy,
		depending on its age. Feta is aged for 2 months, then sold in blocks submerged in brine. It has a salty and tangy flavour, and is oh-so exquisite. </p>
