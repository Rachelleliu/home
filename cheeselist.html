		</div>
		<p> This cheese is dubbed the 'best cheese in the world' by the World Cheese Awards, which means it's definitely
			worth trying.
		<p> This semi-cured cheese is made in Andalusia, in Southern Spain, and is made from the milk of a goat called the 'payoya goat', which is native to the Sierra de Cadiz.
			The flavour is described as being sweet, tangy, and herbaceous. You can get the cheese covered with butter, rosemary, or red pepper. </p>

			<h2 id = "epoisses" > &Eacute;poisses de Bourgogne </h2>
		</div>
		
		<p> &Eacute;poisses de Bourgogne is a cheese made from cow milk, originating in France. This cheese has a very soft texture,once you cut through the red-orange rind.
			It's often served with a spoon because of the runny texture. It's described as being salty, spicy, sweet, and creamy. &Eacute;poisses takes a minimum of 6 weeks to mature, 
			and has a very pungent aroma. This cheese is so smelly that it's actually illegal to carry it on your person on French public transportation.
		
		<div class = "container">
			<img src = "burrata.jpg" width = "90%" alt = "Burrata cheese">
			<h2 id = "burrata"> Burrata </h2>
		</div>
		
		<p> This cheese is kind of like a cheese bomb. It has a thin shell of mozzarella, and the inside is stuffed with soft, stringy cheese curds and cream. 
			When it's cut, all the curds and cream spill out, making a delicious puddle of cheese.
			Burrata cheese was traditionally sold wrapped in leaves; the green colour of the leaves signified the freshness of the cheese. </p>
